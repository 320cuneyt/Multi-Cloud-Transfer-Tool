<h4><b>1.This Repository is now merged with <a href="https://www.caduceus.ml/Rclone-Setup-on-Google-Colab/">Rclone on Google Colab</a> to make your work more simple!üòå</b></h4>
<h4><b>2.The Project is now updated and everything is optimized for new changes made by Rclone v1.58.0 written in 2nd point.</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.In Latest Rclone Version v1.58.0, they made some changes in Auto-Config. Don't worry I am aware of that and till that you can either follow the New Steps or if you are making config file for Google Drive then you can provide your CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET to Work around that situation! I will update you in my Update Channel ,once I find some alternative to help you out in that Step.</b></h4>
<h4><b>4.For auto-config always choose No(n) because we are going to run the Rclone not on our own local device! Otherwise login will not work.</b></h4>
<!--- Step Area Begin --->
<h2><b>üîåBefore you Start!</b></h2>
<h4><b>Please Connect your Google Account, So that Rclone can easily save its progress automatically.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/rq-1.png">
<h4><b>If you want to use your own Rclone config file or the progress saved in your Google Drive in My Drive! Then run the following Code as shown in the image</b></h4>
<img src="Img/rq-2.png">
<h4><b>Run the Time Out Preventer to prevent Google Colab from getting timeout before your Transfer got Completed.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/30.png">
<h2><b>‚öôÔ∏è How to use?</b></h2>
<h4><b>1.First Open the Code on Google Colab: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheCaduceus/Rclone-Setup-on-Google-Colab/blob/main/Rclone.ipynb" alt="Open Code">Open Code</a></b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Now,Before performing anything Run the Code as shown in the Image to download Setup and configure Rclone!</b></h4>
<img src="Img/1.png" alt="1">
<h4><b>3.To Create/Edit/Delete/View comfig file/remote just run the code as shown in the Image.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/2.png" alt="2">
<h4><b>4.After Running the Code! Checkout the available options (shown in image) and choose a type alphabet and hit Enter key to continue, but if input filed is not visible then just click on the blinking line.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/3.png" alt="3">
<h4><b>5.Type n and hit Enter to create a new Config file or Remote and give name, So that you can identify it in future</b></h4>
<img src="Img/4.png" alt="4">
<h4><b>6.Now after Entering the name! You have to choose the cloud for which you have to make config file or remote (by typing its list number), like if you need to make config file or remote of Google Drive then type number "16" and hit Enter</b></h4>
<img src="Img/5.png" alt="5">
<h4><b>7.If you don't know about Client ID and Client Secret then just hit Enter without entering anything! Otherwise this can be used to bypass login into your Google Account</b></h4>

<h2><b>üìëCreating Config File for More Clouds</b></h2>
<p><b>You can learn creating config file for all Cloud Services: <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/">Learn Here</a></b></p>
<h2><b>ü™ùMulti Cloud Transfer</b></h2>
<p><b>Lets move Data from any cloud to any cloud as you want! Since we are using Colab, So it will not consume your Internet or System Resource.</b></p>
<h4><b>1.Before we procced! I recommend to either create or fetch your Rclone Config file to Google Colab using above two methods! Creating and fetching will automatically place the file in correct location!</b></h4>
<img src="Img/24.png">
<h4><b>2.Once you done creating or fetching the config file! Just run the Code named "Connect to Cloud Accounts" and it will automatically detect your config file and will show you  dropdown list to mount multiple remotes as shown in the image. Now select remoted and click mount to connect to those remotes between which you have to transfer your Data.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/25.png">
<h4><b>3.After mounting those remotes or Cloud Accounts, Now click on the File icon as shown in the image and then you will see two folder named "drives" open the second folder named "drives" and you will see the names of Remotes or Cloud Account which you mounted previously!</b></h4>
<img src="Img/26.png">
<h4><b>4.Now Simply open that Folder and copy the file or folder path which needs to be copied and then right click on the file or folder and select "Copy Path" option from the list</b></h4>
<img src="Img/27.png">
<h4><b>5.After that! Paste the path of file or folder in "Source" field and again go to File Icon-->drives and open the Cloud Account into which you want to transfer files/folders and copy its path! You can either directly copy the path of Cloud Account or of any folder inside it and paste the path in "destination" field.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/28.png">
<h4><b>6.Choose the mode to "Copy" otherwise you can use other like "Check". And you can also Enter some extra arguments/flags (optional). Refer to Flag section to see all available flags all arguments!</b></h4>
<h4><b>7.If you want to get notified! when your transfer got completed then tick the Email_notification option and provide Gmail Email ID as well as its password and the Receiver Email ID on which you want to receive the notification!  (optional)</b></h4>
<p><b>
  Email_notification: Select this option to enable following options.<br>
  logs: Check this option to also get log in Mail.<br>
  emailID: Enter your Gmail ID.<br>
  password: Enter Password of given Gmail ID.<br>
  Receiver_ID: The Email ID on which you want to receive the Notification.
  </p></b>
<img src="Img/29.png">
<h4><b>8.Dry Run option is just to check the Source as well as destination path without copying anything.(Optional)</b></h4>
<h4><b>9.Finally! Run the code by pressing Play button to start transferring. Enjoy!üôÉ</b></h4>
<h2><b>üéåFlags</b></h2>
<h4><b>You can use Arguments to control the behavior or customize the command as per your need! Here is the list of all flags:</b></h4>
<h5><b><a href="https://rclone.org/flags/" alt="Global Flag Page">Show Flags</a></b></h5>
<h2><b>üéØPoints to be Remembered</b></h2>
<h4><b>1.Always choose No (n) for Auto-Config because we are not going to use Rclone on our Local Device/Machine otherwise login will not work!</b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Don't forget to type '!' before executing any custom Rclone Command.</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.For Safety! Rclone will always save progress in your My Drive! Not in any of your Shared Drive.</b></h4>
<h4><b>4.Use the Dry Run option to check both Source and Destination path without copying anything.</b></h4>
<h4><b>5.You can either choose the path of Cloud Account folder or anyother folder inside it</b></h4>
