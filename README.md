<p><b>Lets move Data from any cloud to any cloud as you want! Since we are using Colab, So it will not consume your Internet or System Resource.</b></p>
<h2><b>‚öôÔ∏è How to use?</b></h2>
<h4><b>Since this repository is just a small part of my Large prpject <a href="https://www.caduceus.ml/Rclone-Setup-on-Google-Colab/">Rclone on Google Colab</a>, So please read it there to learn about all tools!</b></h4>
<h4><b>1.Before we procced! I recommend to either create or fetch your Rclone Config file to Google Colab using above two methods! Creating and fetching will automatically place the file in correct location!</b></h4>
<img src="Img/24.png">
<h4><b>2.Once you done creating or fetching the config file! Just run the Code named "Connect to Cloud Accounts" and it will automatically detect your config file and will show you  dropdown list to mount multiple remotes as shown in the image. Now select remoted and click mount to connect to those remotes between which you have to transfer your Data.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/25.png">
<h4><b>3.After mounting those remotes or Cloud Accounts, Now click on the File icon as shown in the image and then you will see two folder named "drives" open the second folder named "drives" and you will see the names of Remotes or Cloud Account which you mounted previously!</b></h4>
<img src="Img/26.png">
<h4><b>4.Now Simply open that Folder and copy the file or folder path which needs to be copied and then right click on the file or folder and select "Copy Path" option from the list</b></h4>
<img src="Img/27.png">
<h4><b>5.After that! Paste the path of file or folder in "Source" field and again go to File Icon-->drives and open the Cloud Account into which you want to transfer files/folders and copy its path! You can either directly copy the path of Cloud Account or of any folder inside it and paste the path in "destination" field.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/28.png">
<h4><b>6.Choose the mode to "Copy" otherwise you can use other like "Check". And you can also Enter some extra arguments/flags (optional). Refer to Flag section to see all available flags all arguments!</b></h4>
<h4><b>7.If you want to get notified! when your transfer got completed then tick the Email_notification option and provide Gmail Email ID as well as its password and the Receiver Email ID on which you want to receive the notification!  (optional)</b></h4>
